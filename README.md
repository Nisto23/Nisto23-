Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?

Using plain language instead of technical jargon is essential for improving comprehension, especially when communicating with a diverse audience. Here’s why:

For instance, "implement a solution" could be replaced with "put a solution in place," which is more straightforward.

Saying "use" instead of "utilize" reduces cognitive load and makes the message more relatable.

Accessible language makes content inclusive for people with different backgrounds and education levels.
5. Enhances Accessibility:
People with cognitive disabilities or non-native speakers benefit from clear and concise wording.
